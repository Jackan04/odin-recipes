Welcome to Odin Recipes, my first project as part of The Odin Project. This project is a simple website that displays a collection of recipe links.

## Project Overview
Odin Recipes serves as a foundational project to showcase my growing skills in web development, specifically in HTML. The website features a clean, straightforward design with easy navigation to various recipes.

## In this project, I demonstrate the following skills:
